# Streamlit Learning and Mastery Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I am learning and mastering **Streamlit**—a powerful framework for creating data applications with Python. This repo contains a series of projects, experiments, and examples that demonstrate my journey in building interactive web applications using Streamlit.

## 🚀 About this Repo

This repository is a collection of my **learning progress** with Streamlit. As I explore its features and capabilities, I'll be continuously adding new projects and improving old ones. Here, you'll find:

- **Streamlit Apps**: Interactive web applications powered by Streamlit, showcasing data analysis, visualization, and user interfaces.
- **Tutorials and Demos**: Small, self-contained projects demonstrating key features of Streamlit, including widgets, layouts, charts, and data manipulation.
- **Experimentation**: Exploration of new features and integrations with other libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.).
  
## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master the fundamentals of Streamlit, including layouts, widgets, and real-time updates.
- Build interactive applications that integrate with external data sources (APIs, databases, etc.).
- Explore advanced Streamlit capabilities like custom components, caching, and deployment on platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Cloud.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** – Primary tool for building interactive web apps.
- **Python** – The core programming language.
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**, **Plotly** – For visualizations.
- **Other Libraries** – Depending on the project, I may also integrate other tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Plotly Dash.

## 📌 Projects

Here are some of the notable projects I'm working on:

1. **[Basic Data Dashboard](#)** – A simple app displaying interactive data visualizations using real-world datasets.
2. **[Machine Learning Model Visualizer](#)** – Visualize how different machine learning models perform with varying datasets.
3. **[Weather App](#)** – Real-time weather data fetching and displaying in an easy-to-read interface.
4. **[Sentiment Analysis Dashboard](#)** – A text-based sentiment analysis tool with live results from social media feeds.
